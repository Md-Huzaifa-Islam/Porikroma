-- Keep only essential tables that are actually being used

-- Keep these core tables:
-- users (âœ… actively used)
-- trips (âœ… actively used)
-- trip_users (âœ… actively used)
-- destinations (ðŸ”¶ has backend support)
-- transportation (ðŸ”¶ has backend support)
-- accommodations (ðŸ”¶ has backend support)
-- expenses (ðŸ”¶ has backend support)
-- local_services (ðŸ”¶ has backend support)

-- Verify what remains
